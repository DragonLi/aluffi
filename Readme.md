Solutions to the exercises in Paolo Aluffi's excellent text "Algebra: Chapter
0". I have styled the document in the same way as the book.

I hope to produce a LaTeX source file with just the exercises, so that one can
just fill in their solutions.

This document uses several latex packages and depends on the `pdflatex` program.
I just have the entire TeX live library installed so that `pdflatex` just works.

If you spot any errors in my solutions, please let me know! I am not aware of 
any comprehensive set of exercise solutions.
