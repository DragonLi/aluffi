Solutions to Paolo Aluffi's *Algebra: Chapter 0*.

*Algebra: Chapter 0* is a highly regarded introduction to abstract algebra and
category theory. The writing is fantastic and the exercises are very fun.

I am doing this for at least two reasons:
1. You can work work through the text as well! You will require some
   mathematical maturity, i.e. you should be able to write mathematical proofs
   or have taken a discrete math course.
2. So that you can spot errors. I'm not doing the exercises as part of a course
   so I don't really get graded.

The text is available for free online. It should also be at your college
library.
